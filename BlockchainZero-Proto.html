            <p>Welcome to the Zero-Blockchain interactive demo. This tool simulates the process of creating and adding blocks to a blockchain, demonstrating the core principles of blockchain technology, including transaction aggregation, block creation, mining, and chain addition. Explore the immutable and decentralised ledger that underpins cryptocurrencies and other blockchain applications.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the Zero-Blockchain Demo</h2>
            <p>By pressing the "Add New Block" button, you initiate the simulation of several core blockchain operations. The demo showcases how transactions are bundled into blocks, how blocks are mined through a proof-of-work process, and how they are then added to the blockchain, extending the ledger.</p>
            <p>The demo includes features like dynamic difficulty adjustment based on transaction volume, a simulation of the mining process, and the creation of an immutable chain of blocks. Each block contains a set of simulated transactions, a unique hash, a nonce that has been discovered through mining, and links to the preceding block, demonstrating the interconnected nature of blockchain technology.</p>
            <p>This interactive tool is designed to provide a hands-on understanding of how blockchain works, making the technology more accessible and understandable.</p>
